This paper provides a framework for thinking about how the job search of workers affects the market power of employers. We present a way of thinking about this which encapsulates popular existing models in which employer market power is based on either frictions in labor markets or imperfect substitutability among jobs. We show how this model can be used to compute measures of the extent of employer market power and relates them to popularly used measures of concentration ratios. We use data on the search behaviour of Swiss unemployed to investigate the number of employers being considered by job-seekers using 'clicks' on vacancies to define consideration sets.

This paper investigates how recruiters shape occupational mobility in the labor market. Prior research has emphasized workers’ decisions, largely overlooking the role of firms. We leverage unique click data from a recruitment platform. Our identification strategy exploits the fact that we can see the same applicant information that recruiters observe, making selection on observables plausible. We find that recruiters strongly favor candidates whose current occupation matches the advertised job. Nevertheless, non-matching candidates also have substantial hiring probabilities. Finally, we show that recruiters adjust their hiring patterns to occupational labor market tightness partially offseting occupational scarcity. Our estimates suggest that recruiter decisions account for roughly one third of occupational transitions.
